# Snake Game(Terminal-Based)
A simple Snake game built in C language using the ncurses library.  
The game runs entirely in the terminal.

## Features
- Classic snake gameplay in a text-based interface  
- Score display and restart option after game over  
- Smooth movement and dynamic food generation  
- Built using only standard C and ncurses  

## How to run the game
You can play this game directly online using the **OnlineGDB C compiler** (https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_c_compiler) by pasting the code and switching to the terminal view.
Alternatively, you can install the **ncurses library** and the **GCC compiler** on your local system to compile and run it from your own terminal for a smoother experience.

## Controls
- Arrow Keys - Move the snake
- q - Quit
- r - Restart(after game over)

## End note
This project is a simple recreation of the classic Snake game - built purely in C for the terminal.  
It utilizes linked lists for the snakeâ€™s body management, dynamic memory allocation for smooth gameplay, and the ncurses library for terminal-based graphics and input handling.
